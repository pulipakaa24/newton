    After constructing :class:`Model`, :class:`State`, and :class:`Control` (optional) objects, this time-integrator
    may be used to advance the simulation state forward in time.

    Rigid-body velocities use Newton's public ``(v_com_world, omega_world)`` convention throughout integration and
    constraint projection. Enabling restitution adds velocity-level contact constraints without changing that
    integration path for other bodies.

    Limitations:
        **Momentum conservation** -- When ``rigid_contact_con_weighting`` is
        enabled (the default), each body's positional correction is divided by
        its number of active contacts.  This improves convergence for stacking
        scenarios but means the solver does not conserve momentum at contacts.
        Reported per-contact forces (see :meth:`update_contacts`) are
        approximate: for contacts between two dynamic bodies the force is
        computed using the harmonic mean of the two bodies' contact counts,
        which is symmetric but not exact.

        **Reported parent-joint forces** (see :attr:`~newton.State.body_parent_f`,
        populated when the extended state attribute is requested) are
        approximate.  XPBD applies relaxation factors
        (``joint_linear_relaxation``, ``joint_angular_relaxation``) to each
        joint constraint correction, and with a finite ``iterations`` count
        residual constraint error remains at end-of-step, so the reported
        wrench is the *applied* constraint reaction rather than the exact
        wrench needed to enforce the joint perfectly.  The convention matches
        :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverFeatherstone` and
        :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverMuJoCo`: it is the spatial wrench
        transmitted from the parent through the inbound joint, in world frame
        at the child body's COM, **including** both the constraint reaction
        and the body-frame contribution of :attr:`~newton.Control.joint_f`.
        In equilibrium this wrench counters all applied forces (gravity,
        contacts, ``State.body_f``) by Newton's third law.

    Joint limitations:
        - Supported joint types: PRISMATIC, REVOLUTE, BALL, FIXED, FREE, DISTANCE, D6.
          ROD joints are not supported.
        - :attr:`~newton.Model.joint_enabled`,
          :attr:`~newton.Model.joint_target_ke`/:attr:`~newton.Model.joint_target_kd`, and
          :attr:`~newton.Control.joint_f` are supported.
          Joint limits are enforced as hard positional constraints (``joint_limit_ke``/``joint_limit_kd`` are not used).
        - :attr:`~newton.Model.joint_effort_limit` bounds the drive force (``joint_drive_mode`` ``"pd"`` or
          ``"implicit"``); :attr:`~newton.Model.joint_armature` enters as added child-body inertia when
          ``joint_armature_inertia`` is ``"isotropic"`` or ``"axis"``.
        - :attr:`~newton.Model.joint_friction`, :attr:`~newton.Model.joint_velocity_limit`,
          and :attr:`~newton.Model.joint_target_mode` are not supported.
        - Joint-owned mimic relationships are supported for PRISMATIC, REVOLUTE, and D6 joints.
          Equality constraints and the deprecated sparse mimic constraints are not supported.

        See :ref:`Joint feature support` for the full comparison across solvers.

        Args:
            model: Simulation model to integrate.
            iterations: Number of constraint-solver iterations per time step. Defaults to 2.
            soft_body_relaxation: Relaxation factor applied to tetrahedral constraint corrections
                [dimensionless]. Defaults to 0.9.
            soft_contact_relaxation: Relaxation factor applied to particle-particle and particle-shape contact
                corrections [dimensionless]. Defaults to 0.9.
            joint_linear_relaxation: Relaxation factor applied to positional joint constraint rows (the linear
                correction and its moment about each body's COM) [dimensionless]. Defaults to 0.5 (0.7 before
                1.7, when the moment was scaled by ``joint_angular_relaxation``; with consistent rows, 0.7 injects
                energy into a floating 44-body humanoid because the corrections of a body's joints are summed).
            joint_angular_relaxation: Relaxation factor applied to rotational joint constraint rows
                [dimensionless]. Defaults to 0.4.
            joint_linear_compliance: Compliance shared by linear joint constraints [m/N]. Defaults to 0.0.
            joint_angular_compliance: Compliance shared by angular joint constraints [rad/(N·m)]. Defaults to 0.0.
            rigid_contact_relaxation: Relaxation factor applied to rigid contact constraint corrections
                [dimensionless]. Defaults to 0.8.
            rigid_contact_restitution_iterations: Number of outer iterations of the rigid-body restitution
                velocity solve. Each outer iteration solves every contact manifold (body pair) independently
                with a fixed number of inner Gauss-Seidel sweeps, then couples manifolds by averaging the
                resulting velocity changes per body, so values above 1 primarily matter when a body
                participates in several manifolds (or when a large manifold leaves its inner sweeps
                under-converged). Defaults to 2.
            rigid_contact_con_weighting: Whether to divide each rigid body's contact correction by its number of
                active contacts. Defaults to ``True``.
            angular_damping: Rigid-body angular velocity damping coefficient [1/s]. Defaults to 0.0.
            joint_legacy_relaxation: Whether to restore the pre-1.7 scaling of positional joint rows, which scaled
                the linear part of a positional correction by ``joint_linear_relaxation`` but the moment of the same
                impulse about each body's COM by ``joint_angular_relaxation``. With unequal factors that applies an
                inconsistent impulse (a pendulum responds to a joint torque 43 % too fast and to gravity 18 % too
                slowly at the former defaults). Defaults to ``False``: each row applies one consistent impulse,
                positional rows scaled by ``joint_linear_relaxation`` and rotational rows by
                ``joint_angular_relaxation``.
            joint_drive_mode: How position/velocity drives (:attr:`~newton.Model.joint_target_ke`,
                :attr:`~newton.Model.joint_target_kd`, :attr:`~newton.Model.joint_effort_limit`) are solved.
                ``"pd"`` (default): the spring ``ke * (target_pos - q)`` of the state at the start of the step (exact
                static equilibria at any iteration count) and a backward-Euler damper ``kd * (target_vel - qd)`` solved
                as a constraint row on the velocity after the other joint rows, the total clamped at the effort limit.
                A fraction ``1 / (1 + kd * dt * w)`` of the spring is applied as a joint force before the solve and the
                rest inside the damper row (``w`` the inverse inertia or mass of the two bodies along the axis), so
                light, heavily damped links (fingers) follow the damper instead of receiving an explicit velocity
                kick; the explicit fraction is further scaled by ``1 / (1 + x^2)``, ``x = ke * dt^2 * w``, with the
                remainder also moved into the row, which keeps it stable on very light links. ``ke`` [N/m or N·m/rad] and ``kd`` are the stiffness and damping.
                ``"implicit"``: implicit (backward-Euler) PD rows with an impulse accumulated over the iterations,
                exact when the iterations converge, stable for any gains. ``"compliance"``: the former compliance
                rows (compliance ``1 / ke``, damping ``kd / ke``, no multiplier accumulation), whose effective
                stiffness grows with the iteration count and which ignore the effort limit.
            joint_drive_relaxation: Relaxation factor of the drive rows (the damper of ``"pd"``, the PD rows of
                ``"implicit"``) [dimensionless]; a row is exact for its own DOF in one step at 1.0. Defaults to 1.0.
            joint_armature_inertia: How :attr:`~newton.Model.joint_armature` of rotational DOFs enters the dynamics:
                ``"none"`` (default: ignored, as before; models that already add their armature to the body inertia
                keep working), ``"isotropic"`` (``armature * I3`` added to the child body's inertia; always a valid
                inertia; recommended with ``joint_drive_mode="pd"`` and stiff drives on light links) or ``"axis"`` (``armature * a a^T`` about the joint axis; may violate
                the triangle inequality of the inertia). Maximal coordinates cannot represent a rotor exactly; both
                are approximations that are exact about the axis when the parent is fixed.
            joint_extra_iterations: Number of joint-only passes after the ``iterations`` passes of contacts and
                joints [dimensionless]. Defaults to 0.
            joint_coloring: Whether to solve the joints Gauss-Seidel by color: joints are partitioned so that no two
                joints of a color share a body, and each color is solved and applied in turn (as many passes as the
                largest number of joints on one body). Otherwise all joints are solved at once and their corrections
                summed per body (Jacobi). Defaults to ``False``.
            body_contact_forces: Whether to record the net rigid-contact force on every body during :meth:`step`,
                available afterwards as :attr:`body_contact_force`. Defaults to ``False``.
            enable_restitution: Whether to apply restitution to rigid and particle-shape contacts after the
                positional solve. Defaults to ``False``.
            deterministic: Opt-in determinism for this solver's atomic-emitting
                kernel module. Pass a :class:`warp.DeterministicMode`, or
                ``None`` (default) to inherit the current
                ``wp.config.deterministic`` mode.
